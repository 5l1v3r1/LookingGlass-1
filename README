This search should work for any dataset. If you want to use a different
dataset with this search, see the app/dataspec folder for the necessary files-
1. nsadata.json: A data spec with the name of each field and details about how
it is used/where it should show up.
2. nsadata_url.json: The URL to download the raw data.
3. hidecolumns.json: The indices of the columns to hide by default in the table.
